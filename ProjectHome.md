This project focuses on simulating small simple creatures that can interact with their environment. This is done by a 'program' they all carry, consisting of 'proteins' which act as recognition patterns for patterns in the environment, which they can manipulate or move. If the mass of a pattern in the world is bigger than that of the creature, also called fusicle, then the fusicle itself will move. They can gather energy and mass from environmental patterns and from other fusicles that they can use to create offspring. This offspring will have mutations in their 'program' which will cause them to be better or worse at creating offspring. This way evolution will occur and complex behavioural patterns might emerge.
